                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#4A5568]">
                  In the heart of northern Ghana, a visionary entrepreneur
                  recognized more than just the basic need for household
                  products. She saw a path to empowerment and community growth.
                  Nogma H Enterprise was founded with a passion for creating
                  high-quality, affordable, and locally produced goods that
                  support both hygiene and healthy living. What began with small
                  batches of liquid soap made in her home kitchen quickly gained
                  traction due to its exceptional quality, affordability, and
                  refreshing scent. As demand increased, so did her ambition.
                  Today, she also offers hands-on training in the production of
                  both liquid and bar soaps, catering to individuals who wish to
                  learn and start their own ventures. She is available for
                  personalized, one-on-one sessions designed to fit your
                  schedule. Just reach out and book her services. We invite you
                  to support Nogma H Enterprise. Once you experience our
                  products and services, we're confident you'll be glad you did.

                Joseph Payre. She started with Tombrown, powdered pepper, and
                groundnut paste. In 2021, another dream led her to introduce
                liquid soap, training over 5,000 people in the Tolon District.
                Her products have received FDA approval. She was named Best

                training from Kosmos Innovation Center, TVET Ghana, and the
                Canadian Youth Programme. She currently manages 7 workers and is
                building a production space for Tombrown. She works with a board
                of directors to grow her business. Her goal is to become the
                leading female entrepreneur in Northern Ghana and expand
                globally.
